# VBA_Challenge

## Overview of Project
This project exists to analyze a workbook of stocks to identify total daily volume traded to theoretically inform the quality of the stock's performance.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to assess the daily volume of stocks relative to stock performance/return with consideration of the VBA code used to analyze the data set over years 2017 & 2018.  Additionally, the code will be refactored to identify any differences or changes in efficiency notable enough to implement into further stock assessments.

## Analysis

### Outcomes and Conlusions
The analysis showed that with a stock's greater daily trade volume the return would generally yield higher than stocks with lower volume. However, it's clear that stocks were more significantly responsive to larger market trends as indicated by their generally collective positive or negative return over year (2017 = positive & 2018 = negative).

### Refactoring
Refactoring is an essential part of any project. Some specific code can be useful for first iterations, but over time refactoring code to a more efficient state can set up loops requiring fewer steps, use less memory, and generally improve the logic to make it easier to read and apply later.

Refactoring is relevant in this project because the standard code may be utilized for just a few stocks or perhaps in an ongoing fashion for extensive numbers of stocks. The original VBA structure was ideal for a smaller dataset since the code was easily referenced, checked, and amended for the data.  However, with the published, refactored code we find faster executions of the code which implies more efficient logic.
